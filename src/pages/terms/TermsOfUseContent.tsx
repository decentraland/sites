      <Paragraph>
        The Decentraland Platform (&quot;Decentraland Platform&quot;) is a community-driven virtual space supported by Decentraland
        Foundation (the &quot;Foundation&quot;) and guided by its users through transparent governance.

      <Paragraph>
        You are solely responsible for determining what, if any, Taxes apply to your LAND parcel related transactions, and any other
        transaction conducted by you. The Foundation does not, and will not, have any insight into or control over any transactions

      <Paragraph>
        You acknowledge and agree that the Tools do not store, send, or receive LAND parcels. This is because LAND parcels exist only by
        virtue of the ownership record maintained on the Tools&apos; supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network. Any transfer of a LAND
        parcel occurs within the supporting blockchain in the Ethereum network, and not within the Tools.

        from other users via the Tools, any financial transaction that you engage in will be conducted solely through the Ethereum network,
        Layer 2 solutions or other sidechains via Web3 providers. Decentraland will have no insight into or control over these payments or
        transactions, nor does it have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, Decentraland will have no liability to
        you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the Tools,

      <Paragraph>
        6.2 Ethereum requires the payment of a transaction fee (a &quot;Gas Fee&quot;) for every transaction that occurs on the Ethereum
        network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized Ethereum network. This means that you will need to
        pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the Tools. You accept that the payment of the Gas Fee is inherent to the nature
        of the Ethereum network and alien to the Foundation or due to the use of the Tools.

      <Paragraph>
        6.3 As per a DAO&apos;s decision, transactions taking place in the Marketplace will be subject to a 2.5% MANA cost (the
        &quot;Marketplace Transaction Cost&quot;) calculated over the amount of MANA involved in such transactions. Such MANA cost will be
        borne by the participants to the transaction. All MANA spent under the Marketplace Transaction Cost will be transferred to the
        treasury of the DAO. Please be aware that transactions in third-party NFT marketplaces (inside or outside Decentraland) may be
        subject to the fees charged by said third-party marketplaces as per the respective terms and conditions. The Foundation and/or the
        DAO shall have no liability whatsoever with regards to transactions conducted in third-party marketplaces.

        &quot;Taxes&quot;) associated with your use of the Tools (including, without limitation, any Taxes that may become payable as the
        result of your ownership, or transfer of any NFT and any activity conducted by you in Decentraland). Except for income taxes levied
        on the Foundation, you: (i) will pay or reimburse the Foundation for all national, federal, state, local or other taxes and
        assessments of any jurisdiction, including value added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other
        import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as

        not control the Content of each LAND parcel and does not assume any liability or obligation in connection thereto. All Content
        uploaded to LAND must comply with the Content Policy. The Foundation holds the Intellectual Property Rights over the LAND smart

        Property Rights to the purchaser. To the fullest extent possible, the creator will waive any moral rights over the NFTs upon
        transfer to third parties. Neither the Foundation nor the DAO have any Intellectual Property Rights over NFTs created by users. All
        NFTs must comply with the Content Policy.
