# Security Policy

_Last updated: 2026-05-14_

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this repository or in
any service it interacts with, please report it privately so we can address it
before it is publicly disclosed.

- **Email:** [security@decentraland.org](mailto:security@decentraland.org)
- **GitHub:** [private vulnerability report](https://github.com/decentraland/sites/security/advisories/new)
  via GitHub's "Report a vulnerability" workflow. Preferred when the issue is
  specific to this repository, as it keeps discussion attached to the source.

When reporting, please include as much of the following as possible:

- A clear description of the issue and its impact.
- Steps to reproduce, including affected URLs, requests, or commits.
- Any proof-of-concept code, screenshots, or logs.
- The environment (`decentraland.org`, `decentraland.zone`, `decentraland.today`)
  and the approximate time of testing.
- Your name or handle for credit (optional).

Do **not** open a public GitHub issue or pull request for security reports.
Do **not** disclose the issue on social media, blogs, or chat platforms until
we have confirmed a remediation timeline with you.

## What to Expect

We aim to respond to every report on a best-effort basis. Typical targets:

- **Acknowledgement:** within 3 business days of receipt.
- **Initial assessment:** within 10 business days of acknowledgement.
- **Remediation updates:** at least every 14 days while a fix is in progress.
- **Coordinated disclosure:** publication date agreed with the reporter; we
  generally aim for ≤ 90 days from acknowledgement, sooner for issues with an
  active exploitation risk.

If we miss a target, we will tell you why and propose a new date — we will not
go silent.

## Scope

### In scope

- Source code in this repository.
- Build, deployment, and CI configuration in `.github/`, `vercel.json`,
  `scripts/`, and `api/`.
- Production deployments served from `decentraland.org`, `decentraland.zone`,
  and `decentraland.today` that are powered by this codebase.
- Published artifacts derived from this repository (e.g. the `@dcl/sites` npm
  package and any deployed bundles that contain code authored here).

### Out of scope

Reports limited to the items below will generally be closed without
remediation. They may still be useful as context, but they do not by themselves
qualify as a vulnerability:

- Findings that depend on physical access, social engineering of Decentraland
  staff, or compromised user devices.
- Denial-of-service via volumetric traffic, large request floods, or other
  resource-exhaustion attacks against shared infrastructure.
- Self-XSS that requires the victim to paste attacker-supplied content into
  their own browser console or address bar.
- Reports generated solely by automated scanners without a working
  proof-of-concept or a demonstrated security impact.
- Missing security headers, weak TLS cipher preferences, or other "best
  practice" findings that do not exploit a concrete weakness.
- Vulnerabilities in third-party services we consume (please report those
  directly to the upstream vendor; we are happy to help coordinate).
- Issues that only affect unsupported branches, archived deployments, or
  preview URLs that are not linked from production.

## Safe Harbor

We will not pursue legal action against researchers who:

- Make a good-faith effort to comply with this policy.
- Limit testing to accounts, content, and data that you own or have explicit
  permission to access.
- Avoid privacy violations, data destruction, service degradation, and any
  attempt to access data belonging to other users.
- Stop testing and report immediately if you encounter user data, credentials,
  or production keys.
- Give us reasonable time to remediate before any public disclosure.

This policy is intended to be consistent with the principles set out in
[disclose.io](https://disclose.io). To the extent we are able to grant such
authorization, we consider good-faith research conducted under this policy to
be authorized for the purposes of computer-misuse statutes such as the U.S.
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA). We cannot waive claims brought by third
parties, nor guarantee that other jurisdictions will recognize this
authorization. If a hosting provider, registrar, or other third party
challenges your testing despite this policy, contact us at
[security@decentraland.org](mailto:security@decentraland.org) and — where
reasonably possible — we will confirm in writing that your activity was
authorized under this policy.

## Supported Versions

Only the `master` branch and the currently deployed production build are
supported for security fixes. Older tags, branches, preview deployments, and
forks do not receive security updates from this repository.

## Recognition

Reporters who consent to attribution will be credited in the published GitHub
Security Advisory for their finding and, where applicable, in release notes.
Published advisories are visible under the repository's
[Security tab](https://github.com/decentraland/sites/security/advisories?state=published).
Decentraland does not currently run a paid bug bounty program; recognition is
by attribution and, where applicable, swag.
